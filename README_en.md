# 📚 Edusemi-Plus

**Edusemi-Plus** is an advanced extension of the foundational education project [Edusemi-v4x](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/Edusemi-v4x).  
It explores the **geopolitics, corporate strategies, market structures, and product architectures** that shape the global semiconductor industry and broader tech landscape.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **"Why was this technology born?"**  
  Understand the **economic, political, and historical context** behind the development of key technologies.

- **"How does the world move?"**  
  Analyze the **interplay between macro factors** such as global politics, policies, and investment with the semiconductor sector.

- **Support for strategic decision-making**  
  Provide engineers, managers, and educators with the **perspectives needed for real-world technology and strategy choices**.
