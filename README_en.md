# 📚 Edusemi-Plus | Applied Educational Materials Connecting Semiconductors, Society, and AI

**Edusemi-Plus** is an advanced extension of the [Edusemi-v4x](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/Edusemi-v4x) foundational series,  
designed to explore the semiconductor-centered tech industry from multiple angles—  
**geopolitics, corporate strategy, system architecture, AI, quantum technologies, and investment**.

- 🌍 Emphasizes the intersection of technology and societal structures  
- 🧠 Supports exploratory learning through ChatGPT × Gemini × Claude  
- 🧑‍🏫 Open resources for education, strategy formulation, and technical design

## 🎯 Purpose of This Series

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🧭 **Contextual Understanding** | Analyze the geopolitical, economic, and policy backgrounds behind technology |
| 🧠 **Critical Thinking** | Explore the "why" behind technology choices, product design, and strategy |
| 🔄 **Bridge to Fundamentals** | Designed to connect fundamental semiconductor knowledge (Edusemi) to real-world industry structure |

> 🆕 **Hot Topic**: The successful operation of Japan’s first 2nm test chip by Rapidus (July 2025)  
> is explored in detail as a real-world case study in semiconductor manufacturing re-entry.  
> See [rapidus/README.md](./rapidus/README.md) for details.
