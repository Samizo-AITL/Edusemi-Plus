# 📚 Edusemi-Plus: Advanced Educational Materials Connecting Semiconductors, Society, and AI

**Edusemi-Plus** is an extended series of the foundational [Edusemi-v4x](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/Edusemi-v4x) project.  
It offers a multi-perspective exploration of the global semiconductor industry by integrating topics such as **geopolitics**, **corporate strategy**, **system architecture**, **AI technologies**, **quantum semiconductors**, and **investment analysis**.

- 🌍 Designed to bridge technical knowledge with global structures  
- 🤖 Supports inquiry-based learning using ChatGPT × Gemini × Claude  
- 🧑‍🏫 Open-source materials suitable for educators, engineers, and strategists
