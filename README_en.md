## 🎯 Objectives

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🧭 **Contextual Insight** | Understand the geopolitical, economic, and policy background of technology |
| 🧠 **Deep Reasoning** | Explore the "why" behind design decisions, industry trends, and strategy |
| 🔄 **Connection to Foundations** | Link technical concepts from Edusemi to real-world industry and social structure |

> 🆕 **New Topic**: In July 2025, Rapidus successfully demonstrated a functional 2nm prototype chip.  
> This case is explored in detail as a major milestone in Japan’s advanced logic manufacturing strategy.  
> See [rapidus/README.md](./rapidus/README.md) for details.
