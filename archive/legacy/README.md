# Legacy Technology

Legacy Technology is not a collection of obsolete processes.

This archive documents **canonical failure-and-recovery cases**
where physical mechanisms directly constrained
yield, reliability, and business decisions.

These cases are preserved not as nostalgia,
but as **reference structures** that still reappear
in modern semiconductor, system, and AI-integrated designs.

## Scope of This Archive

- Semiconductor process integration (1990s–2000s)
- Memory technologies (DRAM, VSRAM, eDRAM)
- Failure physics (leakage, disturb, retention)
- Yield recovery and decision-making under constraints

## How to Read

Each case is organized as:

1. Process / Structure  
2. Observed Failure Mode  
3. Physical Root Cause  
4. Test / Bin Manifestation  
5. Yield Recovery or Strategic Decision
