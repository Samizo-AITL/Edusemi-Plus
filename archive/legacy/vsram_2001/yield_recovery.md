# Yield Recovery and Countermeasures in VSRAM

VSRAM entered production with **extremely low initial yield (~30%)**,
under strong market pressure.

Yield recovery proceeded **in parallel with mass production**.

---

## Constraints

- No major process redesign allowed
- Short schedule
- Mobile market timing critical

---

## Major Countermeasures

### Process-side
- Reduction of plasma exposure
- Careful HF clean count control

### Device-side
- Back-bias strengthening
- CD tightening in critical transistors

### Operation-side
- Refresh parameter tuning
- Stress condition redefinition

---

## Result

- Yield improved from ~30% to **80% class**
- Stable supply for early mobile camera phones
- Final validation of DRAM-derived memory limits

---

## Strategic Outcome

Despite technical success:

- Scalability was limited
- Further temperature margin could not be guaranteed

This led to a **strategic termination**
of DRAM-derived mobile memory development.

---

## Legacy Insight

VSRAM is a textbook case where:
> **Engineering success does not guarantee strategic success.**
